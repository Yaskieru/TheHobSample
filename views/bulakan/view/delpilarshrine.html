		  Marcelo H. Del Pilar was born on this site on August 30, 1850 to Julian Hilario del Pilar and Blasa Gatmaytan. 
		  By the time of the Philippine revolution, Del Pilar was forced to leave his home in Bulakan and escape to Spain 
		  wherein he continued his work along with other progressives like Jose Rizal, and Graciano Lopez Jaena.[1] Marcelo Del Pilar, 
		  otherwise known as Plaridel, died of tuberculosis in Spain on July 4, 1896. A few years after his death, his remains were exhumed 
		  and brought back to the Philippines on December 3, 1920 to be laid to rest at the Mausoleo de los Veteranos de la Revolucion in the 
		  Manila North Cemetery.

		  Heading into the 21st century, a historical marker was placed on the site in 1939 by the Philippine Historical Committee, 
		  the precursor of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. A shrine to commemorate Plaridel was first conceived in 
		  1955 by the Samahang Bulacan under the leadership of poet Jose Corazon de Jesus. Later the next year, on August 30, 1956 during the 
		  celebration of his birth day, a ground-breaking for the said shrine was held. The event was headed by former President Ramon Magsaysay 
		  and was blessed by Rev. Fr. Vicente Marasigan, S.J. grandson of the Del Pilar. In 1957, Speaker Jose Laurel donated a sum of Php. 49, 000 
		  for the construction of the shrine. The development of the site as a shrine (including a bronze statue purportedly to be done by National 
		  Artists Guillermo Tolentino) was not completed, however. In August 30, 1982, a ten-foot tall statue of Del Pilar was erected at the center of 
		  the birth site. The monument was done by renowned Maloleno sculptor Apolinario P. Bulaong using cement mixed with crushed bronze. Afterwards, 
		  the 4,027 square meter birth site was donated to the Bulacan Provincial Government by the family of Plaridel’s youngest daughter, 
		  Anita Del Pilar-Marasigan through Atty. Benita Marasigan-Santos. On August 30, 1983, the site was turned over to the National Historical Institute 
		  (now the National Historical Commission of the Philippines) and was from that point on, known as the Marcelo H. Del Pilar Historical Landmark. 
		  After roughly six decades of being interred at the Manila North Cemetery, the remains of Marcelo Del Pilar was transferred to his birthsite on August 30, 1984. 
		  His remains were laid to rest under his monument. Atty. Marasigan-Santos later on had a mausoleum built behind the monument and re-interred the remains of their 
		  family members, among them Plaridel’s wife, Marciana “Tsanay” Del Pilar. Sculptor Bulaong was once again commissioned to create a mural depicting the hero’s life.

		  Upon the celebration of the Del Pilar’s centennial death anniversary, on July 4, 1996 former President Fidel V. Ramos ordered allocation of 
		  funds for the erection of a museum-library at the back of the site. The construction was undertaken by the municipal government of Bulakan, 
		  Bulacan and was inaugurated on August 30, 1998. The administration of the museum-library was handed over to the NHI on February 15, 2000. 
		  Contrary to local rumors, the museum-library was not patterned after the original bahay-na-bato house of Marcelo Del Pilar.
