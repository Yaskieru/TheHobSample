           Bustos was a part of the town of Baliuag as its barrio during the Spanish Period.
		   The town was separated from Baliuag by a tragic incident when around 1860,
		   a rainy Sunday, a group of natives from Bustos with babies in their arms were on their way
		   to St. Augustine Parish Church of Baliuag for baptismal when they drowned when the raft or
		   planceta they were riding capsized while crossing the wild river of Angat due to the strong
		   water current. This fateful event led the people of Bustos to request and build their own parish
		   church to be able to avoid crossing the wild river for community safety. The people chose Holy
		   Child Jesus (Sto. Niño) as their patron saint in honor of those infants that died in the river.

          Bustos also gained its independence from Baliuag in April 29, 1867 through the painstaking efforts and sacrifices
		  of its inhabitants with the integration of barrios Bonga Mayor and Bonga Menor. The town got its name from Don Jose
		  Pedro de Busto[s], a mining engineer from Asturias, Spain, and right-hand of Simon de Anda y Salazar who was appointed
		  tenyente heneral alkalde of Bulacan and an aide of a Spanish Governor General of the Philippines during the late 1700s. 
		  But the town became a part of Baliuag again during the American period. Bustos became also a part of the historical World 
		  War II in the Philippines and it served as the headquarters of soldiers in the province of Bulacan during the war in 1945.

          Bustos was again separated from Baliuag and became a distinct municipality on January 1, 1916 during the Philippine Assembly
		  through 4th Philippine Legislature Assemblyman Ricardo Lloret Gonzalez. After a year when the town became a distinct municipality
		  the town inaugurated its Municipal Hall on January 1, 1917. Leon Prado became its first local leader and served from 1917 to 1919. 
		  Padre Gabriel Alvarez served as the first parish priest of the institutionalized Sto. Niño de Bustos Parish Church.

          <br>
		  With the theme "Bustos Sentenaryo : Isang Daan tungo sa Ikasandaan", Bustos is about to celebrate its 100th year 
		  founding anniversary in the same time with the 7th Minasa Festival and is expected to happen at the month of January 2017. 
		  Sto. Niño de Bustos Parish Church, on the other hand, will also celebrate its 150th year founding anniversary as an independent parish church.
