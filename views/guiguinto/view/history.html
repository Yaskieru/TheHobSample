         Guiguinto began as a barrio of Bulakan, the former provincial capital of Bulacan. 
		 It is said that Spaniards set up an army post in the barrio to serve as a resting place for forces 
		 going to Northern Luzon. In those days, travel throughout Guiguinto was difficult and slow down to cross 
		 single file over a narrow bamboo bridge. Their Filipino guides would cry out, "Hinto" (stop). The Spaniards 
		 thought this was the name "Hihinto". The Spaniards substituted "Gui" (with hard "g") for the Tagalog "Hi". 
		 The place has since been called Guiguinto. On the other hand, old timers say that on moonlight nights, a golden 
		 bull emerges from the church and goes down to the nearby river to quench his thirst. It then returns to the church, 
		 ascends at the altar and disappears. The elders' aid that there are buried jars of gold in town, as indicated by the bull, 
		 and that is why the town was called Guiguinto. It became an encomienda in the 1591 but the ecclesiastical administration was 
		 under Bulakan Convent and it was established as a Town in 1641.

          In 1800, an Augustinian friar erected a small chapel in what is now barrio Sta. Rita. In 1873, roads were constructed 
		  in barrio Malis. The people barrios of Pritil, Tabe, and Cutcut even those days were mostly farmers. During Holy Week, 
		  villagers of barrio Tuktukan held contest for the hardest egg shells (chicken, duck or goose by knocking eggs together 
		  (Tuktukan)). The women tried to help each other in singing the "Panica".

          Just before the outbreak of the revolution of 1896, the town people of Guiguinto were ordered to sleep in the town at 
		  night and to work in their fields only in the day. This was said to have been suggested by the town priest to the authorities 
		  because of rumors that many of the town people were joining the secret revolutionary society, the Katipunan. Guiguinto eventually 
		  contributed many soldiers to the 1896 revolution.

		  At the time of American occupation, the new colonizers reorganized the Province of Bulacan into Nineteen Municipalities 
		  from the original Twenty-Six. Under populated town were subordinated with the large one and the Town of Guiguinto was 
		  integrated in the Town of Bulakan for almost eleven years. In 1915 Guiguinto regain its township again with Antonio Figueroa 
		  as its Municipal Mayor of the moidern period.The town's population was then about 4,000. The 1960 census placed Guiguinto's 
		  population at 10,629. Guiguinto is bounded on the east by the town of Balagtas, on the west by Malolos, on the north by Plaridel, 
		  and on the south by Bulacan.
