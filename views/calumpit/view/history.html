          Calumpit was already an established "barangay" even before the coming of the Spaniards. 
		  It was under the leadership of Gat-Maitim. Agriculture was the main source of livelihood of 
		  the people and even today it is part of the town's lifeblood. Calumpit at that time was the 
		  center of trade and barter among its neighboring barangays. The Pampanga and the Quingua rivers 
		  served as the arteries through which the goods coming in and out of Calumpit passed. This was a 
		  factor why Calumpit became a progressive place during that period. The said rivers at present, still 
		  serve as arteries for trade and commerce in Calumpit. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Calumpit was derived from the name of the hardwood trees called Calumpit, found abundantly growing in 
		  front of the Calumpit Catholic Church. The hardwood was widely used and from then on it was adopted as the town's official name. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          The defeat of Rajah Soliman at the battle of Bangkusay Channel paved the way for the Spaniards to establish their 
		  government in Manila. News reached the Spanish authority that there was a progressive community located several 
		  miles north of Manila. Through the order of Fray Martin de Rada, he sent a group of Augustinian missionaries headed 
		  by Father Diego Vivar Ordones to look for the said place. In 1572, they first set foot at that place. Armed with a cross, 
		  they Christianized the place and established the church and government simultaneously that same year.

          <br>
          <br>
		  It was only in 1575 however; the King of Spain officially recognized That Calumpit. It was the first established 
		  town in the province of Bulacan and the fourth in the island. The Augustinian friars were the first Christian pastors 
		  of Calumpit and acted in some capacity as government officials. This continued for almost a century. In 1672, the first 
		  civil government was established with Marcos de Arce as the first Alcalde Mayor of Calumpit.

          <br>
          <br>
		  Like any other inhabitants of the province, the Calumpit people are religious, hospitable and industrious. 
		  Dwelling places thrive along the riverbanks. Its neighboring places are Apalit and Candaba towns in Pampanga 
		  and Hagonoy, Pulilan and Malolos in Bulacan.
