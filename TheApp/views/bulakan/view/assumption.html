		  The parish and the first church was established by the Augustinian Fathers in 1575 as a sub-parish of Tondo. 
		  In 1578, the town of Bulakan was proclaimed a separate parish from Tondo. According to the historical marker, 
		  during the British invasion in 1762 the Bulakan Church was razed by fire. The construction of the present church 
		  and convent was started in 1812 by Father Gaspar Folgar, OSA. The church had sustained damages due to various natural 
		  calamities: earthquakes on June 3, 1863; October 1, 1869; and the Luzon earthquakes of 1880, which heavily damaged structures 
		  not only Bulakan town but most of Luzon Island.

		  The church was subsequently repaired after experiencing damages: major repairs on the earthquake-damaged bell tower in 1877 by Father Marcos Hernandez,
		  OSA (through the planning and construction of Don Ramon Hermosa and Don Jose Fuentes – a plaque commemorating the builders of the tower can be seen at
		  the first level of the bell tower façade); and in 1884 when Father Francisco Valdes, OSA rebuilt the church after the 1880 earthquake. The present style
		  of the church can be attributed to his repairs. Finally, Father Patricio Martin, OSA finished the restoration of the church in 1885, with Father Domingo
		  de la Prieta finishing the bell tower’s restoration in 1889.

		  The church is the site where Filipino general Gregorio Del Pilar secretly distributed the pamphlets made by his uncle, Marcelo H. Del Pilar, 
		  a prominent member of the Propaganda Movement during the late 1800s.
