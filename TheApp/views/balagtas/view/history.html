          Balagtas is a first class urban municipality in the province of Bulacan, Philippines.
          According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 73,929 people
          With the continuous expansion of Metro Manila, the municipality is now part of Manila's
          built up area which reaches San Ildefonso in its northernmost part.
          Formerly known as Bigaa, it was renamed in honor of Filipino poet Francisco Balagtas.
          The MacArthur Highway bisects the municipality of Balagtas as this national road cuts
          northward to the Ilocos region. At the southern approach of the town from Manila is a modern,
          first class concrete bridge that crosses the Balagtas River. The river, navigable by banca and
          motor boats, empties into Manila bay after snaking through the town of Bulacan to the West which
          provides Balagtas' townsfolk with fish, shrimp, and other fresh water food.

          At the foot of the bridge, along the highway towards the North, is the town hall.
          In front of the town hall is spacious park where the monument of it hero, Francisco Balagtas is located.
          The town hall is surrounded by Spanish colonial type houses. Two hundred meters from the municipal
          hall is the barrio of Panginay, the birthplace of Francisco "Balagtas" Baltazar, for whom also "Balagtasan",
          a form of debate in versified Tagalog, was named. In reverence to the hero's deeds, the official name of
          Bigaa was changed to Balagtas through the legislative act sponsored by the late Congressman, Teodulo Natividad.

          In 1946 the Historical Society of the Philippines placed a marker at the birthplace of Balagtas, which reads:
          "Here in Barrio Panginay, Bigaa, Bulacan, Francisco Baltazar (Balagtas) was born on April 2, 1788. Son of
          Juan Baltazar and Juana de la Cruz, he is the father of Tagalog language and the author of the deathless
          "Florante at Laura." He died in Udyong, Bataan on February 20, 1862."
